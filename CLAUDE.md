# When a request is made, it is passed to the manager for dispostion
# After the manager decides the scope, resourcing and actions, it will print on the screen this plan out prior to assigning work
# work will be assigned to sub-agents based on the managers analysis

- software will be kept to low complexity - no tricky code - everything should be obvious and explainable.
- tests should adhere to the 80/20 rule - the project does not need 100% coverage but should be well covered and the tests should meaningfully test and verify requirements
- any time there are changes to functionality the documentation should be checked to make sure that design and requirements stay in sync. Minor changes do not merit requirements or design changes.
